They are always saying, "You can't put the clock back." 
The simple and obvious answer is "You can." 
A clock, being a piece of human construction, can be restored by the human finger to any figure or hour. 
In the same way society, being a piece of human construction, 
can be reconstructed upon any plan that has ever existed.

Dīcunt semper, "Revertēre hōrologium nōn potes."
Respōnsum simplex et manifēstum est "Potes."
Hōrologium, quod est opus hūmānum, potest revertī digitō hūmānō ad aliquam hōram.
Societās etsī, quod est opus hūmānum, potest cōnstruī iterum, secundum quodlibet cōnsilium quod umquam fuit.
